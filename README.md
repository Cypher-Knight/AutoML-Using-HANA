<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About the project 
### What's this?
This is a simple but accurate Automated Machine Learning library. 
Based on SAP HANA powerful in-memory algorithms, it provides high accuracy in multiple machine learning tasks. 
Our library also uses numerous data preprocessing functions to automate routine data cleaning tasks. So, hana_automl goes through all AutoML steps and makes Data Science work easier.  
### What is SAP HANA?
From [www.sap.com](https://www.sap.com/products/hana.html): 
SAP HANA is a high-performance in-memory database that speeds data-driven, real-time decisions and actions.
